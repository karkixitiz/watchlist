### Watchlist Spring Boot MVC
Simple spring boot MVC application in java.

## Reference
    - Using Spring Initializr to bootstrap a new application (https://start.spring.io)
    
    - Build tool maven
    
    - Deployment: Packaging- putting all files to single bundle  executable and put it on server. Deploying.. Three meathods
    
        1) Packing with a fat JAR:
        
        A fat JAR includes compiled code, resources, and a servlet container.
        It is streamlined, without the hassle of installing a web server and deploying the app to a server. 
        
        2) Packaging with a WAR file:
           A WAR file is a compressed file that contains multiple file bundles.
           It requires the installation of a web server, like Tomcat. 
           It used to be a standard practice, but is less popular than using fat JARs. 
           
        3) Using Maven without packaging.
